# Volatility Prediction

This project develops machine-learning models to forecast short-term realized volatility for a large universe of stocks using high-frequency order book data.

Volatility prediction is crucial for:

	•	Options pricing
	•	Intraday risk management
	•	Algorithmic & high-frequency trading
	•	Portfolio hedging


Project Goals:

	•	Build features from limit order book data
	•	Compute log returns and realized volatility
	•	Train ML models to predict 10-minute future volatility
	•	Evaluate using RMSPE
	•	Provide a reusable and extensible codebase
